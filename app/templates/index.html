        <p>Peterhead Football Club are a football club based in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. They currently play in Scottish League One after winning the Scottish League Two Championship in the 2013–14 season.</p>
        <p>Their home ground is Balmoor in Peterhead, with a capacity of 3,150. The current manager is Jim McInally, who was appointed on 7 October 2011 following the sacking of John Sheran on 23 September 2011 after the side won only one game in 17 matches.</p>
        <p>Peterhead's traditional rivals are the Highland League team Fraserburgh; however, since their election to the Scottish Football League this rivalry has waned. They now have a new rivalry with Elgin City. On 22 November 2011, Peterhead earned a
            game against Celtic in the Scottish Cup, which was held at their stadium, Balmoor, on 8 January 2012. The visitors won 3–0. On the opening game of the Scottish Third Division 2012–13 campaign, Peterhead achieved one of their greatest results
            by earning a 2–2 draw against Rangers, denied victory by an 89th ­minute equaliser. On 20 January 2013 Peterhead hosted Rangers for a second time that season, the game was watched by 4,855 spectators. This is Balmoor's all­time record attendance
            with approximately 400 more fans than the previous fixture. On Saturday 18 April 2014, Peterhead clinched their first trophy as a football league club by winning the Scottish League Two title, beating Clyde 2–0 at Broadwood Stadium.</p>
